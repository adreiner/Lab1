                <p>Erikson uses psychoanalytic ideas to interpret Martin Luther’s revelation in the tower by examining Martin’s early life. Growing up, Martin did not have a great relationship with his parents. Both of his parents were authoritarians and turned to violence when it came to punishing their children. </p>
                <p>Hans Luther, Martin’s father, was typically the one doing the reprimanding. Aside from being strict, his parents were also religious and extremely superstitious which had an effect of Martin Luther’s ego/ psychological development. The revelation came at a time where Martin was beginning the first stage of development and just starting to mature and understand his identity.</p>
